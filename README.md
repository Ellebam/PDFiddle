Clicking on one of the mentioned icons will lead to the corresponding panel where the file processing is handled. 
The following sections show step by step instructions for working with the applications features:



  ****************************************PDF MERGER****************************************
  PDF Merger combines multiple PDF-Files into a single PDF-File containing all others. You can select your PDF-Files by clicking on the "select" button.
  You are not limited by the number of PDF-Documents you want to merge (a high number of files will take longer to merge though). Files are combined in the 
  order they are added to the merge list and are shown with full name in the panel. You can change the order of the single documents by simply clicking the
  "Up" and "Down" buttons on any file entry display item (click the "cancel" button for removing a file from the merge list).
  Clicking the "Merge" button will open a dialog where you can choose your desired saving directory. The file will be saved named "mergedPDF.pdf" in the folder 
  you have chosen.
  !! ATTENTION macOS !!:
  Since this application was mainly designed for Windows this step differs on macOS. Choosing a folder in a directory will save the file in its PARENT Folder
  while naming the file after the choosen folder (e.g. choosing the Documents folder inside the Users folder will save the file inside the Users folder named 
  "Documents\mergedPDF.pdf)
  
  After successful merging of files a user message is displayed and the panel is refreshed.
  
  
  
  
  ****************************************PDF SPLITTER****************************************
  PDF Splitter splits a PDF-Document in smaller PDF-Files. After selecting the desired PDF-File by clicking the "select" button the file is displayed as a 
  preview. Also, a drag down option panel is displayed where you can choose the number of split points you want to have (1 split point = 2 new PDF-Files,
  2 split points = 3 new PDF-Files, and so on). Choosing 0 the default 0 split points will produce a new PDF-File for every Page of the choosen PDF-Document.
